        scope of legal provisions, i.e. if we are obliged to transfer the data
        due to a government or court order, or, (ii) if applicable, legal

      <p>
        In general we do not process any personal data via automated decision
        making including profiling via the Website or Service. However, such
        profiling or automated decision making may happen by third party
        providers through the Website or Service. We will inform you about such

      </p>

      <p>
        Profiling means any automated processing of personal data consisting in
        the use of such personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects
        relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict
        aspects relating to the performance of work, economic situation, health,
        personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or
        relocation of that natural person. Examples of such profiling include
        the analysis of data (e.g. based on statistical methods) with the aim of
        displaying personalized advertising to the user or giving shopping tips.
        The data subject shall not be subject to a decision based exclusively on
        automated processing, including profiling, which has legal effect
        against him or significantly affects him or her in a similar manner.

      <h3>Duration of Storing your Data</h3>
      <p>
        As a rule, we only store your personal data for as long as it is
        necessary for the execution of the contract or the respective purpose
        and limit the storage period to an absolutely necessary minimum. Your
        IP-address and server-log-files (as set forth above) are stored for
        seven (7) days for security and technical reasons.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the case of long-term contractual relationships, such as the use of
        our Service, these storage periods may vary, but are generally limited
        to the duration of the contractual relationship or, with regard to the
        inventory data, to the maximum legal retention periods, e.g. in
        accordance with the German Commercial Code <em
          >(Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB)</em
        >
        and the Tax Code
        <em>(Abgabenordnung, AO)</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Criteria for the storage period include whether the data are still
        up-to-date, whether the contractual relationship with us still exists,
        whether an inquiry has already been processed, whether a process has
        been completed or not, and whether legal retention periods for the
        personal data concerned are relevant or not.
      </p>
