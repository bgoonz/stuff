        Make software engineering collaborative and joyful again.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Developers write software within languages/frameworks, build tools, glue
        them together to (tool) chains, develop against APIs and communicate and
        collaborate with our colleagues. All of that should be efficient, joyful
        and secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet it is not. Devs constantly struggle with larger codebases, cluttered
        dependencies, security policies and unnecessary friction in their
        workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to make developers feel again that everything is at their
        fingertips.
      </p>
      <h2 class="h4 mt-5rem">
        Gitpod was founded because we were frustrated by manually setting up and
        maintaining dev environments.
      </h2>
      <p>
        We are building Gitpod in the open to easily spin-up fresh dev
        environments for any task. Those ephemeral environments are fast &
        powerful, fully automated & initialized. They empower developers to
        immediately start coding, debugging, and testing their code.
      </p>
      <p>Only then developers are always ready-to-code.</p>
      <h2 class="h4 mt-5rem">
        The company was established in 2020 and today over 400,000 devs
        gitpodified their workflows.
      </h2>
      <p>
        We are greateful to be backed by some of the best venture firms and
        advisors of the world. We recently announced a 13m funding round.
      </p>
      <p>
        Come join a quickly growing venture-backed team and work together with
        incredible humans from four continents 🌍
      </p>
      <p>
        We are open minded, transparent and curious. We remain students of the
        game, not masters of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        We aim for a frictionless experience when interacting with our product,
        our company and our brand: no hurdles, no BS, no unnecessary extra
        steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are fully-distributed. You can work from anywhere and schedule your
        working hours the way it fits best for you. We make sure you are all set
        and will treat you well.
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl font-bold">
        We are not as diverse as we would like to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Help us to change that and shape Gitpod’s future from anywhere in the
        world! 🌈 🌍
