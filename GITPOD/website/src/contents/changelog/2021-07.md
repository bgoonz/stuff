## Faster workspace startup times

A key metric we deeply care about at Gitpod (and I'm sure you do too) is workspace startup time. In a world where you create and dispose of workspaces many times per day, the last thing you want is waiting for a workspace to start 🐌.

In this release, we made significant progress in lowering startup times 🏎. What initially may sound like complex changes turned out to be a `+4 -4` pull request ([#4847](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/4847)). Yay simplicity!

To give you an idea of the magnitute of improvement we're talking about, here's a before / after comparison with 30 workspaces started twice:

| Before                                                                                                           | Now                                                                                                          |

Did you pay close attention to the y-axis? From between 20 to 60 seconds down to 5 to 20 seconds!

~~Great work team, let's shift our focus to other features.~~ These improvements are certainly worth celebrating 🎂, but we're hungry to drop these times by at least the same magnitude once or twice more! Team, finish your cake and get back to work 😉.

Please do let us know if you notice any differences with your project startup times. You can find us at [www.gitpod.io/chat](https://www.gitpod.io/chat).
