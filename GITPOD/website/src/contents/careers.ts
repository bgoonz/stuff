    paragraphs: `

    As a product manager at Gitpod you will work on product discovery and product design (not visually) making sure we are always focussed on the most important features at a time. You will be describing new features in design docs which are based on input from users and team members as well as data and “good taste”™. You’ll be supporting the engineering team in understanding the purpose and answering unanswered questions of new product features. You will be always on the lookout for new possibilities and sweet spots that will make our beloved product more useful for our target audience. You are conscious about the limited engineering time and therefore know what to do and what not to do. You are a nice person who wants to work with an open and collaborative remote team of highly motivated engineers.
